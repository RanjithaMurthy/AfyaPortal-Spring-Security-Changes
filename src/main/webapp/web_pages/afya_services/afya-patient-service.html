                                    from tablets and smart phones to search for a clinic or a specific care provider. If GPS is activated in the member’s mobile during the search, the list of clinics and care providers in the vicinity of the member’s geographical location would be listed first. After choosing the care provider or clinic, the members have to log into Afya’s portal or app. All the details of the chosen care provider are displayed.

                                    The member fills up some basic information to request an appointment: (a) choose the preferred date of appointment and (b) explain the health complaint. This request is received at the clinic’s reception, where the chosen slot is allocated to the requesting member based on the care provider’s availability.  An auto-message is sent to the patient’s smart phone, who accepts the slot by making a payment, which is also determined by the corresponding care provider.

                                    This feature allows members to request for prescribed medications to be delivered to their homes. This request can be initiated in three ways:
                                    <br><b>1)</b> When care providers create online prescriptions during consultation, they could provide their patients with the home pharmacy option. If the patients agree, the care providers could choose an Afya-member pharmacy located nearby as part of the online prescription process. The pharmacy automatically gets an online intimation of the prescription and checks the inventory. The pharmacy then generates an online sales order for the patient. The patient makes an online payment and the pharmacy despatches the medications to the patient’s home
                                    <br><b>2)</b> This same process can also be initiated online by the patient with reference to a valid prescription at any later time – not necessarily at the care provider’s clinic. The rest of the process is similar to the first option.
                                    <br><b>3)</b> In case of long-term medications requiring frequent refill (eg, diabetic medication), the patient use the valid prescription to initiate a home pharmacy request.
