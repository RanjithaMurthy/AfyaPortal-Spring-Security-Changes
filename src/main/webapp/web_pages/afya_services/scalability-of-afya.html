        <h2>Building Community </h2>
        <p>Afya Arabia has started building the smart care community from Kuwait, and our aim is to build such smart care communities for each country by widening our presence in the MENA region. But our aim is to expand our geographical reach and widen our healthcare network. This growth would definitely require a constant focus on adapting to changing needs, resource management, tapping potential areas of development, meeting the unique requirements of people belonging to different geographies, scaling up operations to match the rate of growth and maintaining exemplary standards.

        <h2>Functionality</h2>
        <p>Afya aims to extend its reach to include more stakeholders in the healthcare ecosystem such as general hospitals, rehabilitation centres, super-specialty hospital, para-medical professionals, medical gadget and device providers. Hence our constant endeavour is to work on an approach that supports a scalable functionality. Healthcare innovations are the order of the day and drive new trends in care delivery. Afya's functional expertise is set up to adapt to these innovations and new technologies. We understand that every innovation that simplifies healthcare and ensures high quality care experience is a catalyst to achieve the aim of wellness for all.
