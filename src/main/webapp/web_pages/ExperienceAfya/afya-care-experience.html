                        <p>                             
                            In addition to effective treatment of illness, the biggest stress relievers for patients are timeliness; reduced hassle of running between care providers for diagnosis, therapy, medication and other activities; information about their condition and a satisfactory healthcare experience at an optimal cost and with minimal effort. Afya provides patients with the above and many more advantages. Patients enjoy easy access to doctors through online appointments. They benefit from tele-consultation with doctors, home care and home pharmacy. This ecosystem offers patients the advantage of user-friendly applications that decrease their concerns about their overall health and well-being.

                            For payers, the Afya's ecosystem offers a never-before opportunity wherein they can simultaneously connect with patients and integrated services for faster and error-free claims processing thereby reducing cost, delay and errors. Further, a two-way communication is facilitated where payers can directly connect either with patients or providers to communicate vital information about new health plans or any changes in existing plans. This improves the patient satisfaction index and helps in a quicker penetration of insurance services.
