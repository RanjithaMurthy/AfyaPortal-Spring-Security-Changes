                            Afya Arabia - an innovative approach that simplifies care experience by transforming healthcare into smart care

                        <p> 
                            Healthcare in the present day has changed substantially as compared to traditional models, which were two-way interactions involving only patients and care-providers. Current care models are complex, involving patients, multiple care-providers, care-payers and other support services, thus evolving and adopting a holistic approach where patients' preferences are the primary focus. Simplifying the care experience for all the members of the healthcare community is the main objective of this approach. In a nutshell, healthcare is transforming into smart care.

                            Realizing the changing needs of the healthcare community, Afya Arabia, as a pioneer in this innovative initiative, has paved the way for healthcare organizations in the MENA region by establishing a smart care community that will transform the healthcare landscape. This smart care community provides a platform for all stakeholders to co-exist and collaborate within an elaborate healthcare ecosystem. Unlike the traditional model, patients, care-providers and all the other stakeholders can enjoy the benefits of a stress- and anxiety-free care experience as the model offers flexible, simplified and collaborative healthcare delivery at the touch of a button.
