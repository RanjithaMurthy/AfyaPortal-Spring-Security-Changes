        Afya has developed stringent policies that ensure utmost security and confidentiality of information gathered from visitors and members. The scope of security and privacy includes two fundamental aspects - people and technology. Afya uses advanced technology that safeguards data and information. Any information exchange from the system to an external agency is governed by HIPAA guidelines. In this case, vital data is masked, and only generic data is revealed.
        <br><br>
Afya's security standards cover three safeguards - physical, technical and administrative. The physical safeguards include access and audit controls, authentication and integrity. There are five controls under technical safeguards that manage the system at an application level. The highlights of the administrative safeguards include tier 4 data centre norms, physical security, 24 X 7 security guards, biometric entry and mandatory ID cards. These security specifications meet a complete range of industry-specific standards and certifications such as HIPAA, FedRAMP, SOC1 Type 2 and SOC 2 Type 2, ISO 27001 etc. These robust systems ensure the highest standards of security and confidentiality.
