A pictorial representation of these reports and the charts are easy to comprehend and provide an overview of various statistics such as
                                </p>
                       <ul class="approach-ul-1">
                           <li>
                                Spend summary - health expenses covered by insurance versus those borne by the patient
                           </li>
                           <li>
                                Visit summary - in terms of number of visits to the clinic, lab, pharmacy, etc.
                           </li>
                           <li>
                                Insurance approval status and membership usage

                           <li>
                               Trend charts of visits, types of health complaints, etc.

                        <p>The patient can also avail a range of smart services such as online appointment booking for clinic visit or for home visit with your preferred care provider, tele-consultation facilities, and home pharmacy logs.  </p>
<p>The most useful feature is the repository of every single previous and current care visit detail - this repository includes payments made to avail every service, prescriptions, care provider's notes, diagnostic test reports and other related documents. Each of these or an entire set can be accessed and even downloaded.</p>
<p>Thus the format of the patient member area is user friendly and has been designed keeping in mind that patients would want to have easy access to the list of services at all times, would want to review their visit and smart service history, as well as maintain a journal of all the notes, examinations, prescriptions and previous diagnostic test results for future reference. The option to analyze the various observations, especially insurance usage and cash-spent history, in a graphical manner provides a crystal clear picture of the wellness and finance index of the patient. </p>
