                                   Care providers can choose from two membership options - community and premium. Care providers become community members on registering with Afya. The members have access to a dashboard that provides a 360-degree overview of the care provider's business within the ecosystem (e.g., statistics of interactions with patients, clinics, and other stakeholders). The care provider member area also includes "My Network" - where the entire care provider's member network details are available online. The premium membership requires payment of a subscription fee and includes additional packages that simplify the care provider experience. "Loyalty point" is a unique value addition. With Afya's membership care providers can enjoy an organized, well-informed care experience. We invite you to explore our membership services.
