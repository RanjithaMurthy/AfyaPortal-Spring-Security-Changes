                            Community Member
                        </h3>

                        <p>Care providers become community members on registering with Afya. The members can view a dashboard that provides a 360-degree overview of the care provider's business within the ecosystem (statistics of interactions with patients, clinics, and other stakeholders). The dashboard includes a range of metrics, measures and reports to assess the key performance indicators of the specific care provider. </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="clearfix"></div>
                    <div class="icon-div col-md-3 col-sm-3 col-xs-12">
                        <img src="/afya-portal/static/images/prem-member.png" alt="prem-member">
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-md-9 col-sm-9 col-xs-12">                        


                        <h3>Premium Member </h3>
                        <p>The premium membership requires payment of a subscription fee and includes additional features and smart care packages that further simplify the care provider experience. The premium members can not only view the dashboard (which has a wide range of report providing statistical information such as assessment of the smart services rendered to patients, labs, pharmacies and other care providers) but also choose any four major reports that they would want to review the moment they log in - the other reports would also be available in a list format. These personalized reports are also available in graphical formats for easy analysis and interpretation.</p>

                        <p>Another characteristic feature of the premium membership is "My Network" - where the entire care provider's member network details are available online. This space includes many features such as adding new members to the networks (sending and receiving requests between the various stakeholders in the ecosystem), updating contacts of each member in the network (email address) to facilitate communication, and the option to filter and monitor network members and revisit agreements with any of the network members.</p>

                        <p>The additional visibility that the membership provides within the network is a significant advantage. One of the unique features of the premium membership is the "loyalty point." When a premium member refers a care provider to the Afya ecosystem and if the care provider becomes an Afya member, the care providers would receive loyalty points - these points can be redeemed when the care provider pays the subscription fee. </p>

                        <p>Thus with Afya's membership care providers can definitely enjoy an organized, well-informed care experience, where most of their administrative tasks are taken care of by the ecosystem's automation options</p>


                        <p>At Afya we are committed to add further to this extensive list of features you can avail as an esteemed member of the Afya ecosystem. We invite you to explore our membership services	.</p>
